<p>    I have a great interest in small and hands-on mechanical and electrical production. Here are some interesting course practical assignments or extracurricular mini productions.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>1. Force feedback gripper</strong>
  | Timeline: 2021.12.20</li>
</ul>
<p>    The detailed work is shown in the video below. This assignment is derived from the major assignment in the electromechanical system course <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/link?url=GuvnEMoAZwfqpXkEVkcaptMKUOWT13Da0LcRz8U0ZuJLK105rDns-QNk1afLiuAXEjafFMaw0hiqhzSzyF_RECT6E5WFTCrGOrmqw_pXPmU1g_LPySC2Qtp6cbNpUHBA">(teached by Dr. Wang Tianmiao)</a>. At that time, it was during the period when Facebook was promoting the metaverse. Against the backdrop of remote operation needs, we built a simple force feedback gripper using FOC motors and ROS communication within a week.  I was mainly responsible for the design of mechanical mechanisms and the processing of physical objects. The electrical control part is completed by my Tsinghua classmate <a href="https://wangxinhui-bot.github.io/">Dr. Wang Xinhui</a>. The relevant assignments received excellent reviews from <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%88%98%E8%8D%A3/1750288?fr=aladdin">Dr. Liu Rong</a> and Teacher Wang. If you want to learn more about homework details, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Ja14pUvQgoXqJOv0zt_46CBB1bahdsy/view?usp=sharing">please refer to our homework report</a>. Due to the fact that the assignment only took one week to design, the related work may be too rough.

<li><strong>2. Graduation Design: Design and Control of a Small Quadruped Robot with Servo Motors</strong>
   | Timeline: 2021.06.17</li>
</ul>
<p>    Here is my undergraduate graduation project &ldquo;Design and Control of a Small Quadruped Robot with Servo Motors&rdquo;. This work mainly stemmed from my interest in quadruped robots at the time. (This field has almost become my favorite research direction for my master&rsquo;s degree. Later, due to reasons such as laboratory field and cognitive changes, I finally decided to take root in the field of medical robotics). In this work, I mainly used 12 servos to build a small quadruped robot platform with 12 degrees of freedom. The platform utilizes pyboard as the main control. And through the design and simulation of gait trajectory, the trot gait walking is finally realized. Through this graduation project, I have a deep understanding of the development of quadruped robots in my country, and also greatly enhanced my engineering ability.</p>
<p>    If you want to learn more about the desgin, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wECv3k7N9KNhst4c1NdqkJdUattuUTgE/view?usp=sharing">please refer to my report</a>. This &ldquo;Graduation Design&rdquo; mainly focuses on the exercise of mechatronics major ability, and does not study too many scientific issues. If you want to know more about scientific issues in this field, you can pay more attention to the research of <a href="https://www.wzhanglab.site/">Dr. Zhang Wei</a> from SUSTech, <a href="https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1110/1578.htm">Dr. Zhao Mingguo</a> from THU, <a href="https://smen.bit.edu.cn/sztd/szms/znjqryjs/b101017.htm">Dr. Huang Qiang</a> from BIT, <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/0011353/0.html#0">Dr. Zhu Qiuguo</a> from ZJU and so on.</p>

<li><strong>3. Course Design of Microcontroller</strong>   | Timeline: 2021.01.07</li>
</ul>
<p>    Here is a big homework for my major course microcontroller design. The led array on the right in the video is the work of our group. The button music box on the left of the video is an assignment I designed for my classmates. In our group work, I am mainly responsible for the simulation of circuits and the processing of physical objects. (Through this project, my soldering ability has been greatly improved.) The program of the single-chip microcomputer is written in C language, which completed by my classmate <a href="">Dr. Zhu Kezhe</a>.

<li><strong>4. Course Design Assignment for Hydraulics</strong>   | Timeline: 2019.12.05</li>
</ul>
<p>     Here is my junior year course design assignment for hydraulics. Under my call, our team members used linear cylinders to design catapults for the first time. With our design, we ejected the 1kg noon to a distance of 14.06m. This record maintains a record of the course design.This record has not been broken so far. It is worth mentioning that it took us less than a week to design and manufacture this device.

<li><strong>5. Small open source voice assistant project</strong>   | Timeline: 2020.01.30</li>
</ul>
<p>    This is a python open source voice assistant project <a href="https://wukong.hahack.com/#/README">&ldquo;wukong-robot&rdquo;</a> I learned at the end of 2019, which was intended to be used in the mechanical innovation design competition at that time. Later, because of the coronavirus, this small project has been demonstrated at home. The entire project is completed by calling API interfaces such as ASR, TTS, and NLP of platforms such as Alibaba Cloud and Xunfei. in this study. I tried to rewrite the original project, and added a lot of functions such as changing the sound as shown in the video. Through this project, my python programming ability has been greatly enhanced.

<li><strong>6. Early Quadruped Exploration</strong>   | Timeline: 2020.05.07</li>
</ul>
<p>    Around 2020, Boston Dynamics, ETH&rsquo;s ANYmal, South Korea&rsquo;s Ghost and other teams released a large number of interesting quadruped robots. I was also full of curiosity about quadruped robots at the time, and spent some energy to understand the development of legged robots. It&rsquo;s a pity that due to my C++ programming ability and mathematics ability at the time, I couldn&rsquo;t understand the Cheetah open source code that was open source at that time. But this experience set some goals for me to develop complex robots in the future. The following video is a domestic Cheetah quadruped robot purchased in 2020, which was imitated by a domestic team at that time. At present, this team has developed into the <a href="https://www.pxing.com/">Pengxingzhineng team</a>.
